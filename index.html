                <h2>Survival Challenges for the Green Sea Turtle</h2>
                <p>
                    The Green Sea turtle faces many challenges to its survival, both man-made and natural. Every year,
                    less than 1% of hatchlings survive to adulthood. Of the 1% that do make it to adults, the females
                    will return to the location that it hatched to lay its eggs 25 years after being born. Even as
                    adults, the Green Sea Turtles face many challenges including hunting, fishing gear, pollution, and
                    loss of nesting sites.

                <h3>Natural Threats</h3>
                <h4>As an Egg</h4>
                <p>
                    The Green Sea Turtle faces many predators. Even before hatching, the nests face many threats that
                    feast on the eggs themselves. This includes raccoons, dogs, coyotes, foxes, rats, jaguars, jackals,
                    red foxes, and humans. While turtle conservation is rising throughout the world, some areas around
                    the world still collect and consume turtle eggs.
                </p>
                <h4>As a Hatchling</h4>
                <p>
                    Directly after hatching, the turtles face threats from all directions. From land, sea and air.
                    Digging out of their nest, the turtle faces predators on the beach like crabs, fire ants, raccons,
                    coyotes, wild pigs, and dogs. While on shore and once in the water, they also face seabirds from the
                    air. Once in the ocean, they are met by predatory fish, dolphins and other marine life.
                </p>
                <h4>In Adulthood</h4>
                <p>
                    As an adult, there are far fewer natural predators, and the likelihood of their survival increases
                    dramatically. They still face some predators including some species of sharks, killer whales,
                    jaguars, and humans. While the hunting of Green Sea Turtles is outlawed, it still occurs illegally
                    in many regions in the World.
                </p>

                <h3>Man-made Threats</h3>
                <h4>Hunting</h4>
                <p>
                    While harvesting Green Sea Turtles is outlawed wordwide due to their endangered designation, there
                    are still pockets of the world where they are harvested for food, or caught and sold in the black
                    market for decoration, and jewelry. The patterns on their shell is very striking, and has been used
                    historically within furniture, as decoration, and as jewelry. The eggs are commonly eaten within
                    some regions of Mexico, and the adults are consumed in some regions of South and Southeast Asia. In
                    West Africa, sea trutles are often killed for use in medicine and in some traditional ceremonies.
                </p>
                <h4>Fishing Bycatch</h4>
                <p>
                    Some forms of fishing are more destructive than others. Shrimp trawl nets, longline hooks, and
                    fishing gillnets are especially dangerous for Green Sea Turtles. Turtles do not have gills like
                    fish, so they need to come to the surface for air. When entangled in these large scale commercial
                    fishing methods, they often drown before the lines or nets are pulled to the surface.
                </p>
                <h4>Habitat Loss</h4>
                <p>
                    Green Sea Turtles will always return to the the beach they were born to lay their eggs. With the
                    global population of humans growing year over year, the expansion of our cities continue to grow.
                    With one of the most desirable parts of real estate being beachfront property, the uncontrolled
                    development of the turtle's nesting grounds continues to expand. The Green Sea Turtles also feed
                    primarily on seagrass, the expansion of humans causes more pollutants to enter into the ocean which
                    often destroys these feeding locations.
                </p>
                <h4>Pollution</h4>
                <p>
                    Sea Turtles Face many risks due to pollution as adults. Many debris that enter our Oceans are
                    consumed by the fauna within our Seas. This includes Sea Turtles who often choke on the plastics
                    that are within our Oceans. The chemical polutants that enter our oceans degrade the grass seabeds
                    within the environment where the Sea Turtles feed. Building infastructure can also change the flow
                    of fresh water entering our Oceans which affects the amount of sediment (both natural and unnatural)
                    which can drastically change the sea floor and the growth of seagrass.
