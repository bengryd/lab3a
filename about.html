                <h2>My own Journey Learning about Green Sea Turtles</h2>
                <p>
                   In September of 2025 I travelled to Indonesia with my girlfriend and one of our bestfriends. After travelling hours through the Meru Betiri National Park in East Java, we reached Sukamade. In Sukamade we went to Sukamade Beach where we observed an adult Green Sea Turtle laying its eggs. Once the Sea Turtle finished laying its eggs and returned to the Ocean, a ranger dug up the eggs to bring to their hatchery. In the nest, the turtle layed over 120 eggs. The next morning, we returned to the turtle conservation, and released baby turtles that had hatched two days prior. This resonated deeply with each of us in this tour. While most of the turtles hatched are released at night, the rangers set aside a small portion of them to raise awareness for tourists like us.
